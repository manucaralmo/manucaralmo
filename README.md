I am passionate about technology and communications. I entered the world of web development at an early age through self-learning and creating independent projects.

My dedication to thrive in the fields of technology, advertising and design led me to study a degree in Advertising and Public Relations, which gave me great knowledge to apply in my projects.

Due to my restless character and my desire to become a professional developer, I decided to take my education one step further. In 2020 I joined the Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack where I learned the technologies that made me today a Full Stack Developer (ReactJS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express JS, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, Handlebars, Jasmine, Git & GitHub).
