### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am passionate about technology and communication, so from a very young age, I began to enter the world of web development making my small projects.

My passion for technology, advertising communication and design led me to study the degree of Advertising and Public Relations, which gave me great knowledge to apply in my projects.

Due to my restless mind and my desire to become a professional in web development, I decided to become a Full Stack Web Developer. For this I studied the intensive Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack, where I learned technologies such as ReactJS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express JS, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, Handlebars, Jasmine, Git & GitHub.
